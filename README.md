# Juggler_Sequence-GFG
Juggler Sequence is a series of integers in which the first term starts with a positive integer number a and the remaining terms are generated from the immediate previous term using the below recurrence relation:

Your Task:
You do not need to read input or print anything. Your Task is to complete the function jugglerSequence() which takes n as the input parameter and returns a list of integers denoting the generated sequence.

Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(n)

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 100
